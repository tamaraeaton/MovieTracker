// FROM DEV DOCS
Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components
React has two different approaches to dealing with form inputs.

An input form element whose value is controlled by React is called a controlled component. When a user enters data into a controlled component a change event handler is triggered and your code decides whether the input is valid (by re-rendering with the updated value). If you do not re-render then the form element will remain unchanged.

An uncontrolled component works like form elements do outside of React. When a user inputs data into a form field (an input box, dropdown, etc) the updated information is reflected without React needing to do anything. However, this also means that you canâ€™t force the field to have a certain value.

In most cases you should use controlled components

// REMEMBER TO LOOK AT YOUR app.js FOR OTHER INLINE FUNCTIONALITY

FYI
In React, we write even handlers directly on the elements in our JSX
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => alert("hi!")}
>
  Say hi!
</button>
